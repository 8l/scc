* Verify correctness in initializators
* Implement bitfields
* Rewrite error recovery code, and ensure correct state after recovery
* Parse correctly all integer and float constants
* Add C99 features (almost all the new features of C99 are missed)
* Add correct emit for any kind of constant
* Add warning when some ANSI limit is violated.
* Free memory in emit after some error happened.
* Rewrite initializers to deal with the idea of  "current object"
